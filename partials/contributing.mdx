### Forking the main repository

1. To contribute without being a member you can fork the [project repository](https://github.com/powerstackdev/power-stack), see the [Forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) reference
2. Clone your [forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) into your projects folder

### Create a new environment based on your forked repository

3. Create a new web experience by running the following command and replacing **/powerstackdev** with your GitHub username:

`fin project create --name=power-stack --repo=https://github.com/powerstackdev/power-stack.git`
