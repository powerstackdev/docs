# Packages

## About packages

Power Stack is using a monorepo to create and manage packages.

## Packages

One of the key goals for our packages is to be centrally managed but then distributed to their respective open-source
project (e.g. a Drupal module or Gatsby Theme/Plugin).

A new package should contain the following in addition to any specific code.

```
.github/workflows/auto_close_prs.yml
README.md
LICENSE.md
```

In the `.github/workflows/auto_close_prs.yml` there should be a workflow definition to close package PRs automatically
and advise to go to the main project

```yaml
name: Auto Closer PR

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: superbrothers/close-pull-request@v3
        with:
          # Optional. Post a issue comment just before closing a pull request.

            Hi, thank you for your contribution.
            Unfortunately, this repository is read-only. It's a split from our main monorepo repository.
            We'd like to kindly ask you to move the contribution there - https://github.com/powerstackdev/power-stack.
            We'll check it, review it and give you feed back right way.
            Thank you.
```
