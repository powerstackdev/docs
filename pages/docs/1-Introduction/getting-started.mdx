# Getting Started

Getting started with Power Stack's 1-step setup.

## Install Power Stack

To get started with Power Stack, run the following command:

```
fin project create --name=power-stack --repo=https://github.com/powerstackdev/power-stack.git
```

### Dependencies

This setup is utilises Docksal for creating and interacting with the necessary docker container so you will have
configured.

If you haven't setup Docksal yet you can do so by following the instructions on the
[Docksal website](https://docs.docksal.io/getting-started/setup/).

## System requirements

In theory, this setup should support all Docksal supported environments, we simply haven't tested them all yet.

Currently, we've tested using:

```
Docksal version: v1.17.0
MacOS Monterey (12.3)
2.9 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
16GB RAM
```

If you run into an issue on a different OS/configuration please raise an issue and we'll happily look into it.
