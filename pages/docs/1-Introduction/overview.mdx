# Overview

Defining the next generation of digital experiences for the web.

## What is Power Stack?

Power Stack is an open-source core stack to enable users to create power web experiences. It leverages the power of
JAM Stack technologies and a headless CMS to bring an unrivaled experience and performance to all users.

Through the power of low-code, website editors can easily create and edit pages. Backed by a world-class CMS, Power
Stack allows for complex editorial workflows, roles and permissions, and all pages support i18n. All this comes without
compromise because with Gatsby your pages remain blazing fast.
