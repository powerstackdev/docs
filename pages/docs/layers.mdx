## Layers

For each section of the stack, known as "layers," there are individual are top-level standalone components that may
include packages.

As a general rule of thumb, layers should contain a `packages` directory that contains layer specific packages and a
`starters` directory that provides ready to be provision instances of that layer.

Currently, the layers are as follows:

### Backend

### Frontend


### Scripts
