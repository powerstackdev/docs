# Services

For each section of the stack, known as "services," there are individual are top-level standalone components that may
include packages.

As a general rule of thumb, services should contain a `packages` directory that contains service specific packages and a
`starters` directory that provides ready to be provision instances of that service.

Currently, the services are as follows:

### Backend

This service contains the content data storage.  It's built using a headless instance of Drupal.

### Frontend

### Docs

### Local Development

### Scripts
